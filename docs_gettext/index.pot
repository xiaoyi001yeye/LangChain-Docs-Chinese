msgid "LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:"
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/index.rst:6
msgid "*Be data-aware*: connect a language model to other sources of data"
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/index.rst:7
msgid "*Be agentic*: allow a language model to interact with its environment"
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/index.rst:9
msgid "The LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/index.rst:11
msgid "This is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely conceptual guide to LangChain, see `here <https://docs.langchain.com/docs/>`_. For the JavaScript documentation, see `here <https://js.langchain.com/docs/>`_."

msgid "There are several main modules that LangChain provides support for. For each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides. These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:"
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/index.rst:35
msgid "`Models <./modules/models.html>`_: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/index.rst:37
msgid "`Prompts <./modules/prompts.html>`_: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/index.rst:39
msgid "`Memory <./modules/memory.html>`_: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/index.rst:41
msgid "`Indexes <./modules/indexes.html>`_: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/index.rst:43
msgid "`Chains <./modules/chains.html>`_: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/index.rst:45
msgid "`Agents <./modules/agents.html>`_: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/index.rst:64
msgid "The above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/index.rst:66
msgid "`Autonomous Agents <./use_cases/autonomous_agents.html>`_: Autonomous agents are long running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/index.rst:68
msgid "`Agent Simulations <./use_cases/agent_simulations.html>`_: Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other or to events can be an interesting way to observe their long-term memory abilities."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/index.rst:70
msgid "`Personal Assistants <./use_cases/personal_assistants.html>`_: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/index.rst:72
msgid "`Question Answering <./use_cases/question_answering.html>`_: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/index.rst:74
msgid "`Chatbots <./use_cases/chatbots.html>`_: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/index.rst:76
msgid "`Querying Tabular Data <./use_cases/tabular.html>`_: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/index.rst:78
msgid "`Code Understanding <./use_cases/code.html>`_: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query source code from github, you should read this page."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/index.rst:80
msgid "`Interacting with APIs <./use_cases/apis.html>`_: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/index.rst:82
msgid "`Extraction <./use_cases/extraction.html>`_: Extract structured information from text."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/index.rst:84

msgstr ""

#: ../docs/index.rst:86
msgid "`Evaluation <./use_cases/evaluation.html>`_: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this."
